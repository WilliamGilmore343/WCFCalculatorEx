# WCFCalculatorEx
My Version of the Windows Calculator WCF Tutorial. The full tutorail can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial

I was part of a team in my third year of uni where we created a WCF library and a WPF application which connected to an SQL database. 
This was an excercise to remind myself about WCF and WPF applications, aswell as refresh myself on using git.

The app created is a console based application with a client, host and library created in visual studio.
